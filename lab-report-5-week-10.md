# Lab-Report-5 Week-10

#### [My MarkdownParse](https://github.com/brian-schodorf/markdown-parser/blob/main/MarkdownParse.java)
#### [Provided Code For Lab 9](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser)

I just manually combed throught the test files to find a few that I knew would not work. At this stage in my MarkdownParser implementation I have a strong idea of what cases my code can and cannot pass.
